# LinkedIn Profile Scraper using Browser Automation

## üìå Overview

This project is a robust LinkedIn profile scraper that automates the process of extracting data from at least 200 LinkedIn profiles using browser automation, caching, and LLM-agent integration. It handles various anti-scraping measures, session issues, and optimizations to ensure scalability and reliability.

## ‚öôÔ∏è How It Works

1. **Login & Session Management**  
   - Automatically logs in using Selenium or Playwright with secure credentials.  
   - Uses cookie/session persistence to avoid repeated logins.

2. **Profile Navigation & Scraping**  
   - Navigates to each LinkedIn profile URL.  
   - Waits for dynamic content (like job experience, education) to load.  
   - Extracts data using DOM selectors.

3. **Data Caching**  
   - Previously scraped profiles are cached (e.g., in JSON or DB) to prevent re-scraping.

4. **LLM Integration**  
   - Uses DeepSeek or similar models to analyze and summarize scraped profile data.  
   - Ensures chunked data flow to handle LLM context limits.

## üîÑ Logic Flow

Login ‚Üí Load URLs ‚Üí For each profile:
    - Check cache
    - Visit profile
    - Wait for dynamic content
    - Scrape and clean data
    - Store in cache
    - Pass to LLM agent
    - Summarize and return results

## üöß Challenges & Solutions

### 1. LinkedIn Anti-Scraping Measures  
**Problem**: Detected automation ‚Üí account lock.  
**Solution**: Used realistic time delays, random mouse movements, headful browser mode, and proxy rotation.

### 2. Login Issues  
**Problem**: Frequent login prompts and 2FA blocks.  
**Solution**: Session reuse via cookies + manual login fallback for 2FA.

### 3. Dynamic Data Loading Delays  
**Problem**: Incomplete data scrape due to lazy-loading.  
**Solution**: Explicit waits for DOM elements, scroll automation to load more data.

## üìå Key Implementation Highlights

### ‚úÖ Context Limit Handling  
- Broke long profile content into chunks before sending to LLM.  
- Used token counters to stay within model's context window.

### ‚úÖ Loop Prevention  
- Maintained visited profile list.  
- Used caching to skip already-processed entries.

### ‚úÖ Optimizations  
- Headless option toggle for faster performance.  
- Parallel scraping with delay randomization.  
- Suggested future addition: Redis-based job queue for large-scale scraping.

## üìà Future Improvements

- Use Captcha solver APIs for login automation.  
- Integrate MongoDB for scalable data storage.  
- Add dashboard for scraped profile visualization.  
- Deploy with Docker for easy environment setup.
